// 📦 Engine/DisplayPresentation/CelestialStructure.h — every celestial property, in one place, with its slider metadata
//============================================================================================================================================
// 🧩 The single source of truth for sun · sky · clouds · fog · moon · stars. Nothing else declares a celestial
//    default; the ephemeris reads this, the UBO packer reads this, the TOML loader writes this, and (P8) a slider
//    panel is a projection of the metadata below rather than a second list that can disagree with it.
//
//    ⚠️ WHY THE METADATA LIVES NEXT TO THE FIELD. A separate table of "here are the sliders" is a copy, and copies
//    drift: a field gets a new default and the slider keeps the old range, or a field is added and no control ever
//    appears. `CelestialProperty` below binds name · unit · range · default to the field's own address, so a
//    control cannot exist for a field that is gone, and a field cannot be added without declaring how it is edited.
//    CheckCelestialRecord.sh asserts every float field in the struct appears exactly once in the property table.
//
//    Units are stated on every field and are SI unless marked. Angles are degrees in the interface (that is what a
//    person types) and converted to radians at the point of use, never stored half-converted.
//
// Naming: `Structure` per CLAUDE.md §2 — this is a topology/settings representation, not an algorithm.

//------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

// 🔴 THE FLARE IS A LENS ARTEFACT, NOT AN ATMOSPHERIC ONE, AND THAT DISTINCTION IS THE WHOLE DESIGN.
//
//    Everything else in this file describes light in the AIR — scattering, absorption, the sun's own disc. A lens
//    flare happens INSIDE the camera: light that has already arrived bounces between glass elements, diffracts at
//    the aperture blades, and lands somewhere it does not belong. Keeping the two separate matters because they
//    behave differently: the atmosphere's aureole grows as the air thickens, while a flare's ghosts move when the
//    CAMERA turns even though the air has not changed at all.
//
//    ⚠️ THERE IS NO HALO ELEMENT HERE, DELIBERATELY. Every off-the-shelf flare library ships one — Chapman's
//    article, Froyok's UE implementation, and the commercial packs all list "halo" among the standard features.
//    It is explicitly unwanted here: a ring of light hugging the sun is indistinguishable from the atmosphere's
//    own aureole, and stacking one on top of the other is exactly the "sun blending into the atmosphere like a
//    halo" that this project rejected. The three tiers below reach for ghosts, streaks and a starburst — all of
//    which sit AWAY from the sun or have hard radial structure, so none of them can be mistaken for haze.
// 🔴 A DROPDOWN OF LOOKS, NOT A QUALITY LADDER — AND THE LADDER WAS DISHONEST.
//
//    This was originally Off/Low/Medium/High, which implied each step cost more. Measured, it does not: the
//    starburst ("High") is a handful of trig ops with no loop, while the ghosts ("Medium") run a loop over
//    every ghost. The starburst is the CHEAPER of the two. The tiers were really ranking how elaborate each
//    element looks and calling it performance — a label that quietly misleads whoever tunes it later.
//
//    So the selector now picks a STYLE. Each preset is a complete camera character: which elements are present
//    AND how they are shaped, because "which starburst you get" is part of a look rather than a separate hidden
//    knob. Applying a style overwrites the individual settings; Custom leaves them exactly as they are.
